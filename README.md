# One Note desktop app for linux

  A web-app wrapped in Electron to open as a desktop app. Since linux doesn't have a lot of apps.
 
___
This app does not modify or use any direct code from One Note. Just uses [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) to open a browser window, and serve it as a desktop application since Linux does not have an official releases of some apps. Uses Electron's BowserView to display third-party webpage/webapp.

Started because I prefer using separate apps, and not opening everything in my browser. And, because I hate using Ubuntu's dock, and I'd rather have it open in a window of its own and easily accessible from the dock.

## P.S.
This application can also be built for Windows and MacOS. Tested on Windows 10 and Mac OS High Sierra (10.13.6). But WhatsApp has perfectly good desktop apps built with Electron for them. So, I don't know why you would want to, but you can.
